# Environmental Monitoring System

This project implements a simple Environmental Monitoring System in Java. It simulates monitoring various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and air quality using virtual sensors.

## Description

The Environmental Monitoring System consists of the following components:

- **Sensor Class**: Represents individual sensors with properties such as name and value. Each sensor can generate random readings.
- **EnvironmentalMonitoringSystem Class**: Represents the main system, which creates instances of different sensors, generates random readings for them, and displays the sensor information.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
2. Run the `EnvironmentalMonitoringSystem` class to start the monitoring system.
3. View the generated sensor readings for temperature, humidity, and air quality.

## Dependencies

This project has no external dependencies.

## Future Improvements

- Add more types of sensors such as pressure, light intensity, etc.
- Implement methods to analyze sensor data and generate alerts for abnormal readings.
- Integrate with external systems for data logging and analysis.
